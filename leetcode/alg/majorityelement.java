Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
public class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] num) {

        int major=num[0], count = 1;
        for(int i=1; i<num.length;i++){
            if(count==0){
                count++;
                major=num[i];
            }else if(major==num[i]){
                count++;
            }else count--;
            
        }
        return major;
    }
}
public class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
	  int len = nums.length;
	  return nums[len/2];
    }
}

The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. If you find a number Y that is not X, the current counter should deduce 1. The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. This could be explained as "4 X being paired out by 4 Y".//Booyer Moore algorithm
