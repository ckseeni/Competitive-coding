solution for full task:

Now think in opposite way. For each year instead of bought a house in the current year, we sold a house in the current year. Therefore for each year we have to look back on the previous years to find the price which is higher than the current year price and closest to the current year price.

How to do this?

When we are in any current year we already know bout the previous year prices. Sort those prices( you can use set for sort) and then do the binary search on the sorted values to find the optimum price.
